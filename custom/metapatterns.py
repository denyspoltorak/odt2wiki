        "Patterns vary in the ways they share functionality or data among system components, build pipelines, and in their use of dependency inversion or indirection.",
    "Sharing functionality or data among services":
        "Functionality or data may be shared among components through direct access, building a dedicated service, delegation, and replication.",
    "Pipelines in architectural patterns":
        "Pipeline is a unidirectional data flow. Depending on the pattern, it may preserve the data type, data identity, or temporal order of the data stream.",
    "Dependency inversion in architectural patterns":
        "Plugins, Hexagonal Architecture, Microkernel, and Hierarchy rely on dependency inversion. Other patterns, such as Layers and Services, occasionally use it.",

    "Evolutions of Services that add layers":
        "A system of services can be extended with a Middleware, Service Mesh, Proxies, Shared Database, or an Orchestrator which implement cross-cutting concerns.",
